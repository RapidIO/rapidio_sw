=============================================

The purpose of this library is to provide architecture and operating system
independent interfaces towards initiating RapidIO maintenance transactions.

Linux
=====

Using this library within the Linux operating system requires dynamic linkage
against the generic RapidIO mport driver (i.e. CONFIG_RAPIDIO_MPORT_CDEV=y).
The Makefile allows (cross-)compilation of the source code using a pre-built
tool chain and kernel headers. Compile using `make -f Makefile.example'. Use
the following environment variables to provide the tool chain and kernel
headers:
 * CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/tool/chain
 * INCDIR=/path/to/kernel/headers
