============================================

The purpose of this library is to provide architecture and operating system
independent interfaces towards managing a network of RapidIO switches and
endpoints. Local RapidIO master ports and remote RapidIO devices are
abstracted and represented by opaque handles. The user can access registers
of both local and remote devices by supplying these handles.

libriocp_pe maintains a graph of the network in its internal administration,
providing at most one unique handle per unique device. Accessing remote
devices through these handles is implemented via maintenance transactions
towards endpoint ANY_ID; the library changes routes towards this destination
ID on the fly, based on its internal administration.

Linux
=====

Using this library within the Linux operating system requires dynamic linkage
against the generic RapidIO mport driver (i.e. CONFIG_RAPIDIO_MPORT_CDEV=y).
The Makefile allows (cross-)compilation of the source code using a pre-built
tool chain and kernel headers. Compile using `make -f Makefile.example'. Use
the following environment variables to provide the tool chain and kernel
headers:
 * CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/tool/chain
 * INCDIR=/path/to/kernel/headers
