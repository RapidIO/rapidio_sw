==========================================================

The purpose of this set of libraries and applications is to provide
architecture and operating system independent interfaces towards managing a
RapiIO fabric, constructed of switches and endpoints. This set of software
currently supports Linux as target platform but should be straightforward to
port to other operating systems.

Refer to <component>/README for further instructions.
