****** GENERAL NOTES ABOUT THE SCRIPTS *******

- If invoked without parameters, all scripts will respond with the
  list of parameters required by the script.

- A node name of "none" for nodes 2, 3, and 4 is ignored by the scripts.

******* PREPARING TO INSTALL RRMAP - SSH PERMISSION SETUP *******

Note that the scripts below may have already been used to install the 
Linux kernel package.  If so, skip this step after checking that:
- It is possible to ssh root@node to all nodes from the install server node
- It is possible, as root, to ssh <server> without entering a password

The installation script requires SSH password-less root access to the four nodes
of the cluster.  The scripts below can be used to simplify this setup.

- admin_init_root.sh configures passwordless access for a specified user
        on the four nodes entered.
- admin_init_dir.sh creates the directories used by the driver install as well
        as the RRMAP software
- admin_user_add.sh creates the named user account with specified password
        and Linux group on the four nodes specified.
- admin_user_del.sh removes the named user account on the four nodes specified.

To prepare the system for the software install, execute the following sequence.
Note that the script parameters have been left out for brevity.

1) sudo admin_init_root_key.sh to get SSH root access to all four nodes.
2) sudo admin_user_add.sh to create as many users as required
3) admin_init_root_key.sh for each user to get SSH root access to all four nodes
4) admin_init_dir.sh to create the directories on all four nodes
5) On every node, use admin_init_root_key.sh as root to get passwordless access
   to the node.  For example, if SERVER is the ser

******* PACKAGES REQUIRED FOR RRMAP SOFTWARE *******

The following packages must be installed on all nodes for the RRMAP software
to execute correctly:
 - screen
 - doxygen
 - sysfsutils
 - gcc-c++

******* INSTALLING THE RRMAP SOFTWARE *******

To install the RRMAP, run install.sh with the required parameters
for up to a 4 node cluster.

******* RRMAP SOFTWARE OVERVIEW *******

The RRMAP software stack consists of the following functionality:
- Fabric Management
- Utilities
	- File transfer kernel interfaces
	- Goodput (performance analysis)

Create the detailed documentation by executing "doxygen doxyconfig"
in this directory.

Open documentation using "firefox html/index.html"

******* RELEASE NOTES *******

New functionality in RRMAP 7.0 compared to 6.0:
- Fabric Management Functionality
  - Support for scread, scdisplay commands to read and dump Statistics Counter
    information for all supported devices.
    - The scdisplay command allows filtering of which statistics counters
      are displayed.  For more information, enter '? scd" from a Fabric
      Management Daemon command prompt.
  - System configuration has been greatly simplified
    - All slaves now learn the location of the master based on register values.
    - Slaves no longer have a configuration file, only masters have a
      configuration file.
  - Bug fixes for Prodrive Top-of-Rack switch configuration template

- Goodput
  - OBDIO command enhanced to robustly set the size of the outbound window

- Installation Scripts
  - The installation scripts have been modified to use the following approach:
    - A server node is specified which acts as the source for all installed
      software.
    - Each target node has a script copied to it which installs the software:
      - Downloads software from the server
      - makes and installs the software
  - There is now an install_list.sh script, which accepts a file with a list of
    nodes to install.  Type 'install_list.sh' for the format of the file.

New functionality in RRMAP 6.0 compared to 5.0:
- Fabric Management functionality now has the following switch support options:
  - AUTO - Automatically configure all reachable nodes.  The master/enumerating
           nodes requires a /etc/rapidio/fmd.conf configuration file, all
           others just use defaults.
  - RXS  - Support for IDTs RXS2448 and RXS1632 is now available.
	   Rack mountable switch boxes are available from StarBridge.
- The content of the open source version of RRMAP has been restricted to 
  file transfer.  For the complete RRMAP software package, join RapidIO.org
  or contact a RapidIO.org participating company to receive a copy.

New functionality in RRMAP 5.0 compared to 4.2:
- Support for reserved memory areas in RDMA, DMA TUN, and File Transfer.
  Large amounts of contiguous physical memory allow fast operation of RDMA
  and File Transfer, and are required for DMA TUN.
- Optional inclusion of the Centaurus Software RIOSocket kernel module,
  which supports IP Frame Tunnelling through the kernel.
