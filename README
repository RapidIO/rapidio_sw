RapidIO Software Stack distribution Revision 4
- Fabric Management
- Remote Memory Access, with socket style semantics and named memory spaces
- Socket interface implemented with Remote Direct Memory Access
- Raw RapidIO interfaces 
	- management - handles for RapidIO devices (master ports)
	- memops - DMA interface for master ports
		- Optional use of Tsi721 shared or dedicated DMA user mode
		driver for low latency
	- channelized messaging - share single Messaging resource among
	  multiple applications with socket-style semantics.
	- raw messaging - dedicated use of a messaging channel for an
	  application, for Tsi721 User Mode Driver
- Ethernet Frame Tunnelling
	- DMATUN - transport Ethernet frames over RapidIO fabric transparently
		using DMA (higher throughput)
	- MSG TUN - transport Ethernet frames over RapidIO fabric  transparently
		using Messaging (lower throughtput)
- Utilities
	- File transfer kernel interfaces
	- File transfer with Raw RapidIO Interfaces
	- Goodput (performance analysis)
